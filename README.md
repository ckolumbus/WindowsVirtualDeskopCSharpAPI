# Windows VirtualDeskop API wrapper for C#

not a real project yet, but I needed a very thin wrapper for use within another project
and [VirtualDeskop]() was one (very good) alternative with a full-fledged implementation
for all windows versions, but also has to many requirements regarding targetframework and
runtime behavioer (threading!).

Therefore I collected data from the internet, mainly stackoverflow, and put this here together,
maybe it's helpful for others, too.
